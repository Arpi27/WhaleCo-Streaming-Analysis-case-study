# WhaleCo-Streaming-Analysis-case-study


I analyzed WhaleCo's streaming service data, focusing on customer demographics, product performance, and churn analysis. Using Python for preprocessing and Power BI for visualization, I merged datasets to create a comprehensive analysis. Challenges included handling null values and creating predictive models for churn and subscription length. The project provided insights for improving service offerings and customer retention.
